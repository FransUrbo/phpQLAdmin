  * De-globalize the 'reload left frame' value so that the reloading can
    acctually happen!
  * Don't show the minus image before 'no domains' (left-ezmlm.php) if there's
    no mailing lists to display
  * De-globalize ezmlm pages.
    If the 'maximum mailinglist count' is unset, then we're comparing
    'count > NULL' which will always be true. To go around this, use 'count + 1'
    as maximum value (will make the form continue).
  * Don't execute ezmlm commands if debug variable is true OR the file .DEBUG_ME
    exists.
  * Don't allow setting subscriber/rejected addresses when creating a ezmlm
    mailinglist. That part of the code is badly broken (fixing this in DEVEL instead).
  * Allow for reloading of the left frame when new list is create AND 'auto
    reload' is set to true/yes.
    + Do not reload the left frame just because a list have CHANGED!
  * Don't allow deletion of list from the domain lists list. Only from the list details.
  * When deleting a branch, only update the QLC objects (i.e. call pql_control_update_domains())
    if 'Use Controls DB' is set to TRUE. The function isn't availible if
    'Use Controls DB' is set to FALSE...
  * Don't execute ezmlm commands if debug variable is true OR the file .DEBUG_ME
    exists.
  * New option to list_forward() - the list number. This so that when modifying
    a specific list, we're forwarded to this list's details (and not the domain
    list list :).
  * Failure to auto generate {mail,home}Directory doesn't warrant a reload of
    the user data page. We should get to the next page, which will give the user
    a chance to input a correct value.
    Closes bug 186

  * Add uidNumber, gidNumber and homeDirectory to a mail account IF we've
    choosen to use 'posixAccount' when creating user(s).
  * Spelling errors conserning attributes and defines fixed.
  * Predefine (empty) variables to get rid of errors.
  * Correctly process the next page/form to display in user_add.php.
    This depend largely on if we have an MX error or not.
  * Don't set 'host' to 'default' (in tables/user_add-details.inc) if we're not
    running in advanced mode. The host value will be figured out automaticly
    (in user_add.php)...
  * Rewrite the part that adds {User,Group}ID slightly. We use the
    PQL_CONF_FORWARDINGACCOUNT_UIDNUMBER value if it's a mail account, and
    generate a new value using pql_get_next_ugidnumber() if not.
  * The 'userhost' value which is/was generated by user_add.php might be
    an array containing the DNS entry and/or the QLC object(s). The DNS value
    is by default used, othervise the first QLC object.
  * If a define isn't set, the pql_get_define() will return an empty array with
    all rootdn's. Catch this, and return NULL if the define is unset.
  * Don't show the 'undefined variable' warnings if not running a CVS version.
  * Don't add the 'deliveryMode: localdelivery' if we're running with newer QmailLDAP.
  * To make sure we don't get 'Wrong datatype' in tables/user_add-additional.inc
    when checking if the mailHost is a DNS entry, we only look in the QLC
    array if there IS such an array.
  * Suidperl should no longer be used as interpreter in suid perl scripts.
  * For the autoAdd{HostName,RCPTHosts,Locals} stuff to work, the function
    pql_control_update_domains() needs to know the root dn (to be able to find
    the configuration value for the database suffix).
  * Spelling error - s/user_generate_mailstore/user_generate_homedir/.
  * Changing userNamePrefix managed to set the userNamePrefixLength instead.
    + Faulty use of variables in include/attrib.usernameprefix.inc.
  * Don't show the radio input for 'user specified MX' if it's our only option.
  * If the file '.DEBUG_ME' exists in the root directory, don't create domain/users.
    Instead, die with the LDIF that should have been added to the LDAP database.
  * Get the knowledge on what object classess to use when creating user(s) ONCE
    (from user_add.php instead of all over the place), and use this knowledge when
    deciding what input field to show
  * In case the 'user reference value' isn't availible when putting togheter
    the new users RDN, try to fallback to the 'uid' value. If that is also
    unset, die with a message... Best I can do!
  * De-internationalize the gecos attribute - it won't allow non-us characters!
  * Spelling error: s@if/elseif@ in two places where I'm about to call
    user_generate_{mailstore,homedir}(). This stoped the auto-generation of
    {home,mail} directories to use the UID value - CN/SN overwrote the previous
    set UID value.
  * When we can't find the root dn for some reason, i MUST have more information.
  * Make sure that the view is included in change/add locals/rcpthosts value(s)
    so that we end up in the Locals/RCPTHosts view again.
  * Only add the 'homeDirectory' attribute if we've choosen to use 'posixAccount'
    when creating a user - qmailUser allows homeDirectory, but it's not needed
    for mail accounts. Previous fix was wrong...
