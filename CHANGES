phpQLAdmin 2.0 Change Log

phpQLAdmin 2.0.1 Release
	- More independent LDAP database layout. The admin interface
	  should not dictate how a database should look like (or vise
	  versa for that matter!). The admin interface should cope with
	  ANY layout possible. First attempt (it works with mine now :)
	- GUI layout change.
	  + Left frame in three sub frames - Users, Controls and Ezmlm,
	    each reloaded independently when changed.
	  + Sort MX on priority, not FQDN
	  + The nav button (left/right icon) only fonds/unfolds the
	    level, nothing more!
	  + Add a 'delete user' at the bottom of the user details page,
	    so that we don't have to go through the domain details to
	    delete a user.
	- Configure domain defaults in the domain objects description
	  attribute.
		Example:
		dn: dc=bayour,dc=com
		objectClass: top
		objectClass: domain
		dc: bayour
		description: defaultDomain=bayour.com
		description: baseHomeDir=/afs/bayour.com/user/users/
		description: baseMailDir=/var/mail/users/
		description: administrator=uid=turbo,ou=People,dc=fredriksson,dc=com
		description: administrator=uid=khaan,ou=People,dc=bayour,dc=com
	  + Don't show the domain if person loggin in isn't listed in the
	    object.
	  + Insert base values in the database for these when creating
	    a domain.
	  + Change these values on the domain details page.
	- Use authentication to access page(s) - session management.
	  This lead to the removal of the hardcoded values for admin
	  DN and password. Access to database branches is through the
	  domain object and it's "description" field - administrator.
	  + Allow for 'Advanced mode' which gives more information. This so that
	    we can show simple (required) stuff for 'inexperienced administrators',
	    and all the nitty gritty to the pro.
	  + Log each login/logout in ./phpQLadmin.log.
	- Ezmlm mailinglist management. Create and modify a ezmlm mailinglist.
	  + Deletion of list is not availible yet.
	  + Look for lists in baseMailDir/mailinglists for each domain
	- Controls management sorted on host (ie, multiple hosts is
	  manageable) in a tree like fashion.
	- Search for files in current dir 'require("./'. This so that
	  we can have multiple installations on same host, with
	  different configs etc.
	- Configure the LDAP host, port and base search DN in one go,
	  separated with semicolon (;). This saves us some variable
	  + This will allow choosing from a predefined set of LDAP
	    hosts at runtime (independent server choosing for user
	    and controls database).
	    This isn't quite working though. We most likley don't have
	    the same credentials on both servers.
	- Allow for selecting login shell when creating user (open /etc/shells
	  and output list to choose from).
