phpQLAdmin 2.0 Change Log

phpQLAdmin 2.0.4 Release - TO BE RELEASED
	Bug fixes
	  - Got ezmlm mailing list management to work, stress tested it localy,
	    "works for me"... :)
	    + Part of the fix is to have two suidperl script that does a fiew
	      things the webserver/PHP don't have access to (we need to create
	      some directories as root and give away files/directories to the
	      mailing list user - usually 'alias'.
	  - Correctly export environment variables before executing external
	    script.
	  - Correctly get domain default values/administrator (missed some when
	    I changed to my own object class).

	GUI layout change
	  - Left justify the locals/rcpthosts tables in the mailserver control
	    details page.
	  - Allow for creating a script that initializes ldap* files on a new
	    mail server (example script included).

	EZMLM Mailinglist management
	  - Only build the ezmlm frame list tree if there is any lists, and if
	    there isn't any, show 'no lists' as indicator.
	  - Print status message at top of ezmlm details page if there is any.
	  - Add the 'add subscriber' link at the bottom of the 'show list information'
	    table even if there is no existing subscribers.

	Misc changes
	  - Working example of suidperl script 'create_domain.pl' (creates the
	    'baseMailDir/mailinglists' directory - needs to be done as root).
	  - Force usage of objectclass 'phpQLAdminBranch' and 'dcOrganizationNameForm'
	    when creating the domain/branch object.

phpQLAdmin 2.0.3 Release (Jan 13 2003)
	Bug fixes
	  - Documentation update
	  - Missed some include($include) line (prefix with './include/').
	  - Foundation for changing LDAP server(s). If we can't connect/bind
	    to the LDAP server, this must mean we changed server, and we need
	    to reauthenticate. 
	  - The 'Advance mode' checkbox should reload index2.php, not self,
	    and send it to _top.
	  - Fixed the 'are you sure you want to delete ...'. Isn't outputted
	    when PQL_VERIFY_DELETE is true, so I missed this :)
	  - Forgot to increase the created UID Number with one, so we ended up
	    with the same number as the highest one in the database.
	  - Don't build the email@domain TWICE, and the variable is called
	    '$mail', not '$email'!
	  - Make sure we only include the config file (include/config.inc)
	    ONCE (with a simple if() at the top).
	  - Correctly reference the LDAP branch as 'branch' or 'domain'
	    depending on what type of database layout we're using.
	  - If we couldn't bind to the LDAP server, destroy and unset the
	    session completly.
	  - Delete the users group object after we created the user object.

	EZMLM Mailinglist management
	  - EZMLM Manager class(es) removed. Re-implemented what I needed
	    in my own 'include/pql_ezmlm.inc'.
	  - Possibility to set path/command for ezmlm management (should be
	    possible to use scripts/commands that do remote administration).
	  - Search all 'baseMailDirs' for accessible domain (ie, domain tree
	    one have access to) for ezmlm lists. This gives that each domain
	    have lists in there own directory, instead of every single list
	    in something like /var/lists.

	GUI layout change
	  - 'Tablify' the home links (original/new maintainers etc).
	  - Show what user to modify in user_edit_attribute, so we don't
	    modify 'in the blind'.
	  - Show more information
	    + Allow change of LDAP server [y/n]
	    + Verify user/domain deletions [y/n]
	    + Objectclasses used to create users
	    + Domain/Users reference attribute (uid/cn, dc/ou etc)
	    + Domain/Branch owner (telephone number, Contact person etc) in
	      the domain details view.
		Uses the objectclass 'dcOrganizationNameForm' (schema file
		included)
	    + Personal details (telephone number, cell phone etc) in the
	      user details view.
		Uses the objectclass 'pilotPerson'.
	  - Add delete icon/func to each attribute view in the mail server
	    controls view.
	  - Separate form page to create new branch/domain.
	  - Only create the 'controls' and/or 'ezmlm' frames if either of
	    the PQL_LDAP_CONTROL_USE or PQL_LDAP_EZMLM_USE is enabled. It
	    looked funny when both where disabled...
	  - Slightly more information on the 'front page'.
	    - Version number is displayed in bold at the top
	    - Link to CHANGES and the new phpQLAdmin page

	Misc changes
	  - Replace/Modify 'gecos' and 'givenName' entries at the same time
	    we're modifying the 'cn' entry.
	  - Action to create and delete a mailserver. When adding a new
	    mailserver, if we clone an existing one, include all
	    {locals,rcpthosts,passwd} info in clone (configurable with
	    checkboxes).
	  - Enable execution of external add user/domain scripts. Two example
	    scripts is included.
	  - Reasonable zone file creation template included and correctly called.
	  - Use specific attributes to store domain/branch default values and
	    domain/branch administrator. Schema file (phpQLAdmin.schema included).
	    This will break an upgrade - read README.upgrade!!

phpQLAdmin 2.0.2 Release (Jan  4 2003)
	- Documentation update
	
phpQLAdmin 2.0.1 Release (Jan  3 2003)
	- More independent LDAP database layout. The admin interface
	  should not dictate how a database should look like (or vise
	  versa for that matter!). The admin interface should cope with
	  ANY layout possible. First attempt (it works with mine now :)
	- GUI layout change.
	  + Left frame in three sub frames - Users, Controls and Ezmlm,
	    each reloaded independently when changed.
	  + Sort MX on priority, not FQDN
	  + The nav button (left/right icon) only folds/unfolds the
	    level, nothing more!
	  + Add a 'delete user' at the bottom of the user details page,
	    so that we don't have to go through the domain details to
	    delete a user.
	- Configure domain defaults in the domain objects description
	  attribute.
		Example:
		dn: dc=bayour,dc=com
		objectClass: top
		objectClass: domain
		dc: bayour
		description: defaultDomain=bayour.com
		description: baseHomeDir=/afs/bayour.com/user/users/
		description: baseMailDir=/var/mail/users/
		description: administrator=uid=turbo,ou=People,dc=fredriksson,dc=com
		description: administrator=uid=khaan,ou=People,dc=bayour,dc=com
	  + Don't show the domain if person login in in isn't listed in the
	    object.
	  + Insert base values in the database for these when creating
	    a domain.
	  + Change these values on the domain details page.
	- Use authentication to access page(s) - session management.
	  This lead to the removal of the hard coded values for admin
	  DN and password. Access to database branches is through the
	  domain object and it's "description" field - administrator.
	  + Allow for 'Advanced mode' which gives more information. This so that
	    we can show simple (required) stuff for 'inexperienced administrators',
	    and all the nitty gritty to the pro.
	  + Log each login/logout in ./phpQLadmin.log.
	- Ezmlm mailing list management. Create and modify a ezmlm mailing list.
	  + Look for lists in baseMailDir/mailinglists for each domain
	  + Actual action is disabled by default. Set 'ezmlm->debug = 0' if you
	    want to test this. WARNING: HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED LIVE! It just _LOOKS_
	    correct!! I take no responsibility for lost mailing lists!
	- Controls management sorted on host (ie, multiple hosts is
	  manageable) in a tree like fashion.
	- Search for files in current dir 'require("./'. This so that
	  we can have multiple installations on same host, with
	  different configs etc.
	- Configure the LDAP host, port and base search DN in one go,
	  separated with semicolon (;). This saves us some variable
	  + This will allow choosing from a predefined set of LDAP
	    hosts at runtime (independent server choosing for user
	    and controls database).
	    This isn't quite working though. We most likely don't have
	    the same credentials on both servers.
	- Allow for selecting login shell when creating user (open /etc/shells
	  and output list to choose from).
