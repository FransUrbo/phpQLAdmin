phpQLAdmin 2.2 Change Log

phpQLAdmin 2.2.1 TO BE ANNOUNCED
	Bug fixes
	  - If we can't find the givenName, surName, commonName nor the gecos
	    in the user object we have one last chance - the 'user reference'
	    attribute. It might not be pretty, but we see the user...
	  - Include the displayed 'cn' value (in 'tables/user_details-basic.inc')
	    in the call to 'user_edit_attribute.php'. This so that we change a
	    _specific_ value, not the whole attribute list.
	    + Make sure we only replace that value and not the whole thing in
	      'include/attrib.cn.inc'.
	  - Check if inclusion of home directory should be done outside the check
	    if mail host is allowed. Two separate things...
	  - [Merge from HEAD]
	    + Session was started with the path specified in php.ini:session.cookie_path
	      which overwrote session from other installation(s).
	  - Hardcode the group account template into include/pql_templates.inc:pql_get_templates()
	    This because the user add part needs object classes etc to be able to
	    work.

	GUI layout changes
	  - User addition errors is 'tabbed' to the right (aligned with the input
	    fields etc).
	  - If 'MAY' attributes in a user template is empty/unset, we specify
	    'None' instead of an empty line.

	Misc changes
	  - More folding tags added 
	  - Rewrite/Simplify the password encrypt scheme thing. Retreive the
	    values ONES (in 'user_add.php') instead of every time we need to know
	    if a specific value is there (in 'tables/user_add-details.inc').

phpQLAdmin 2.2.0 Release (Mar  2 2005)
	This new stable version is more or less a complete rewrite since 2.0.
	2.2.0 is the same as 2.1.5 (exept the change logs etc).
