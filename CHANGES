phpQLAdmin 2.3 Change Log

phpQLAdmin 2.3.0 TO BE ANNOUNCED
	Bug fixes
	  - Session was started with the path specified in php.ini:session.cookie_path.
	    For me that was '/' which meant that if I have two (or more) phpQLAdmin
	    installations on the same server (which I do - stable, devel and demo etc),
	    they overwrote each others session variable.
	    To avoid this, we must set the 'session.cookie_path' using ini_set() BEFORE
	    session is started. Instead of doing this in every place where session_start()
	    is called, we include the new file 'include/pql_session.inc' which does
	    some additional magic.

	GUI layout changes
	Documentation changes
	Schema changes
	Misc changes
