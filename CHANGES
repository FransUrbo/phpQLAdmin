phpQLAdmin 2.3 Change Log

phpQLAdmin 2.3.0 TO BE ANNOUNCED
	Bug fixes
	  - Session was started with the path specified in php.ini:session.cookie_path.
	    For me that was '/' which meant that if I have two (or more) phpQLAdmin
	    installations on the same server (which I do - stable, devel and demo etc),
	    they overwrote each others session variable.
	    To avoid this, we must set the 'session.cookie_path' using ini_set() BEFORE
	    session is started. Instead of doing this in every place where session_start()
	    is called, we include the new file 'include/pql_session.inc' which does
	    some additional magic.
	    + The 'session.cookie_path' init value must always end with a slash, so make
	      sure it does...
	      Should fix some problems with sessions that won't die or get's overwritten.
	      Not sure exactly what the problem is/was...
	  - Overloading of variables in tables/domain_details-websrv.inc fixed ($server*
	    to $web_srv*).
 	  - If one enters a mailForwardingAddress and:
 	    + qmailDotMode		!= none
 	    + deliveryMode		!= noprogram
 	    + deliveryProgramPath	!= NULL
 	    + ldapDefaultDotMode	== ldapwithprog
 	    then there will be a COPY in the users local mailbox. Solve this by changing
 	    the 'qmailDotMode' and 'deliveryMode'.

	GUI layout changes
	  - Rewrite the way users are listed in the left frame. The attribute 'cn' is
	    the most obvious to show and the way that's shown is also rewritten.
	    + If a user have more than two fields (space separated - 'Ulf Turbo Fredriksson'),
	      then the _last_ part is the lastname and all the others are first names...
	      If memory serves me correctly, this isn't true for arabic/chinese names, but...
	    + After 'cn' comes 'givenName' and 'sn' and after that comes 'gecos'. Last
	      chance is the 'user reference attribute' (whatever that might be - it MUST
	      exists however).
	  - When creating a 'forwarding account' there are two possibilities. Either with
	    local delivery (as well as forwarding) or no local delivery (i.e. only forwarding).
	    Allow this with two radio buttons in the 'Additional account properties' page -
	    'Copy to' (default) or 'Forward to'.
	    + Create objects with real home dirs...
	  - Include a 'NOT' option for user search. Describe what it does and how it works.
 	  - Add a 'Force no local delivery' checkbox when _creating_ a mail forwarding address.
 	    ('Bug fixes' point 3 - mailForwardingAddress creation - above)

	Documentation changes
	Schema changes
	  - Because of the change in the way 'forwarding accounts' where used/created,
	    I lost all purpose of the 'virtualBaseHomeDir' global attribute/configuration!
	    Remove all references to it.
	  - Four new attributes for remote ezmlm lists added to the 'phpQLAdminGlobal'
	    object class:
	    ezmlmRemote				1.3.6.1.4.1.8767.3.2.1.21
	    ezmlmRemoteHost			1.3.6.1.4.1.8767.3.2.4.20
	    ezmlmRemoteUser			1.3.6.1.4.1.8767.3.2.4.21
	    ezmlmRemoteRetreiveScript		1.3.6.1.4.1.8767.3.2.2.21
	  - To be able to remember localy added rcptHosts, I (phpQLAdmin) must put them
	    in another attribute. This to protected the value(s) from a manual replication.
	    The example comes from bug #257 - if the QLC host is only _listenening_ ('backup
	    MX') then there is no branch(es) that have the domain(s) configured as primary
	    nor additional domainname. If a manual replication takes place, then the information
	    about the domain(s) can't be found anywhere...
	    A new object class and a new attribute to add to the QLC object(s):
	    phpQLAdminMXHostAddition            1.3.6.1.4.1.8767.3.1.8      (object class)
            nonPrimaryRcptHosts                 1.3.6.1.4.1.8767.3.2.4.22   (attribute)
	  - Support SimScan configuration (added as MAY to phpQLAdminMXHostAddition and
	    phpQLAdminGlobal):
	    useSimScan	                        1.3.6.1.4.1.8767.3.2.1.22
	    simScanSpamAssassin                 1.3.6.1.4.1.8767.3.2.1.23
	    simScanClamAntiVirus                1.3.6.1.4.1.8767.3.2.1.24
	    simScanTrophie                      1.3.6.1.4.1.8767.3.2.1.25
	    simScanSpamAssassinHits             1.3.6.1.4.1.8767.3.2.4.23
	    simScanAttachmentSuffix             1.3.6.1.4.1.8767.3.2.4.24
	    + Configured/enabled in two places:
	      * Globaly per MX host (in a QmailLDAP/Controls object).
	      * Per branch object
	    + Script to extract and generate the simcontrol file (scripts/extract_simscan.pl)
	      is only started, not finished!

	Misc changes
	  - Administration of mailinglists located on remote server (i.e. not on the same
	    host where phpQLAdmin is running). See WARNING.txt!
	  - Native support for Kerberos V, using the php4-kadm5 module (from the URL
	    http://freshmeat.net/projects/php-kadm5).
	    + Do not export variables PQL_KADMIN_* to the support scripts.
	    + Closes bug 273.
	  - New function - pql_format_return_unixtime() - to return current time as
	    a UNIX timestamp. Good for profiling

[all changelog for <2.3 branch have been removed for space reasons]
