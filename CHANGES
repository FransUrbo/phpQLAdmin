phpQLAdmin 2.2 Change Log

phpQLAdmin 2.2.1 TO BE ANNOUNCED
	Bug fixes
	  - If we can't find the givenName, surName, commonName nor the gecos
	    in the user object we have one last chance - the 'user reference'
	    attribute. It might not be pretty, but we see the user...
	  - Include the displayed 'cn' value (in 'tables/user_details-basic.inc')
	    in the call to 'user_edit_attribute.php'. This so that we change a
	    _specific_ value, not the whole attribute list.
	    + Make sure we only replace that value and not the whole thing in
	      'include/attrib.cn.inc'.
	  - Check if inclusion of home directory should be done outside the check
	    if mail host is allowed. Two separate things...
	  - Hardcode the group account template into include/pql_templates.inc:pql_get_templates()
	    This because the user add part needs object classes etc to be able to
	    work.
	  - Neither of the QmailLDAP schema's are STRUCTURAL (the're AUXILIARY) so
	    we must use 'person' and either 'uidObject' (if referencing users with
	    'uid') or 'qmailUser' as well as 'qmailGroup' when creating QmailLDAP
	    group objects. This because OpenLDAP >2.1 _require_ one STRUCTURAL object
	    class.
	  - If multi-valued QmailLDAP group values in tables/user_details-group.inc
	    _isn't_ multi-valued (i.e. not an array), then _make it_ an array. This
	    so that include/pql_formating.inc:pql_format_table_single() works correctly.
	  - The ACI generation function include/config.inc.CHANGE_ME:user_generate_aci()
	    didn't correctly generate access for all the necessary attributes that
	    QmailLDAP needs. Take MY working function part...

	GUI layout changes
	  - User addition errors is 'tabbed' to the right (aligned with the input
	    fields etc).
	  - If 'MAY' attributes in a user template is empty/unset, we specify
	    'None' instead of an empty line.

	Misc changes
	  - More folding tags added 
	  - Rewrite/Simplify the password encrypt scheme thing. Retreive the
	    values ONES (in 'user_add.php') instead of every time we need to know
	    if a specific value is there (in 'tables/user_add-details.inc').
	  - After using header() one MUST (!) use 'exit' so that the following code
	    isn't executed! Had no idea, just saw it in the manuall.
	    Replace all calls to header() with my own wrapper that does just that -
	    Calls header() (including the URI session value) and then 'exit'...

phpQLAdmin 2.2.0 Release (Mar  2 2005)
	This new stable version is more or less a complete rewrite since 2.0.
	2.2.0 is the same as 2.1.5 (exept the change logs etc).

[all changelog for <2.2 branch have been removed for space reasons]
