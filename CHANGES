phpQLAdmin 2.3 Change Log

phpQLAdmin 2.3.0 TO BE ANNOUNCED
	Bug fixes
	  - Session was started with the path specified in php.ini:session.cookie_path.
	    For me that was '/' which meant that if I have two (or more) phpQLAdmin
	    installations on the same server (which I do - stable, devel and demo etc),
	    they overwrote each others session variable.
	    To avoid this, we must set the 'session.cookie_path' using ini_set() BEFORE
	    session is started. Instead of doing this in every place where session_start()
	    is called, we include the new file 'include/pql_session.inc' which does
	    some additional magic.

	GUI layout changes
	  - Rewrite the way users are listed in the left frame. The attribute 'cn' is
	    the most obvious to show and the way that's shown is also rewritten.
	    + If a user have more than two fields (space separated - 'Ulf Turbo Fredriksson'),
	      then the _last_ part is the lastname and all the others are first names...
	      If memory serves me correctly, this isn't true for arabic/chinese names, but...
	    + After 'cn' comes 'givenName' and 'sn' and after that comes 'gecos'. Last
	      chance is the 'user reference attribute' (whatever that might be - it MUST
	      exists however).

	Documentation changes
	Schema changes
	Misc changes
