phpQLAdmin 2.3 Change Log

phpQLAdmin 2.3.0 TO BE ANNOUNCED
	Bug fixes
	  - Session was started with the path specified in php.ini:session.cookie_path.
	    For me that was '/' which meant that if I have two (or more) phpQLAdmin
	    installations on the same server (which I do - stable, devel and demo etc),
	    they overwrote each others session variable.
	    To avoid this, we must set the 'session.cookie_path' using ini_set() BEFORE
	    session is started. Instead of doing this in every place where session_start()
	    is called, we include the new file 'include/pql_session.inc' which does
	    some additional magic.

	GUI layout changes
	  - Rewrite the way users are listed in the left frame. The attribute 'cn' is
	    the most obvious to show and the way that's shown is also rewritten.
	    + If a user have more than two fields (space separated - 'Ulf Turbo Fredriksson'),
	      then the _last_ part is the lastname and all the others are first names...
	      If memory serves me correctly, this isn't true for arabic/chinese names, but...
	    + After 'cn' comes 'givenName' and 'sn' and after that comes 'gecos'. Last
	      chance is the 'user reference attribute' (whatever that might be - it MUST
	      exists however).
	  - When creating a 'forwarding account' there are two possibilities. Either with
	    local delivery (as well as forwarding) or no local delivery (i.e. only forwarding).
	    Allow this with two radio buttons in the 'Additional account properties' page -
	    'Copy to' (default) or 'Forward to'.
	    + Create objects with real home dirs...

	Documentation changes
	Schema changes
	  - Because of the change in the way 'forwarding accounts' where used/created,
	    I lost all purpose of the 'virtualBaseHomeDir' global attribute/configuration!
	    Remove all references to it.

	Misc changes
