This file should always be empty (exept this header :). That's the idea
any way.

Please check it every time you've done a cvs update, because you MIGHT
ruin your system/db or something else if you don't take notice!!

Warnings of the day:
Administrations of remote ezmlm lists is more or less done. It can
RETREIVE information, but WRITING (in one way or the other) have not
been tested AT ALL! Do not use on live lists, they might be totaly
fucked if I've missed something!!
