This file should always be empty (exept this header :). That's the idea
any way.

Please check it every time you've done a cvs update, because you MIGHT
ruin your system/db or something else if you don't take notice!!

    To see all mail information (mail address, forwards,
    mailserver etc, etc), one now needs to set the

      useUserMailInformation

    attribute in the root DN (schema change - restart LDAP).
    This because my current job doesn't use that part, but
    still want to use phpQLAdmin... Which is nice :).

    phpQLAdmin is now a more generic LDAP user administration
    tool.
