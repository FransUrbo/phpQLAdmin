This file should always be empty (exept this header :). That's the idea
any way.

Please check it every time you've done a cvs update, because you MIGHT
ruin your system/db or something else if you don't take notice!!

Warnings of the day:
As of 2.3.4, phpQLAdmin have support for Automount information. This
required schema changes and also a new config define in include/config.inc
(PQL_CONF_SUBTREE_AUTOMOUNTS).

Please make sure to update both your LDAP server (new schema) and your
include/config.inc (look for the line reading PQL_CONF_SUBTREE_AUTOMOUNTS
in include/config.inc.CHANGE_ME).

To demostrate the use of Automounts in LDAP, the file demo/automounts.ldif
is included. Very rudimentary, but it will give you an idea.

Please make sure you read the file doc/README.automounts for more information
about this new support.
