This file should always be empty (exept this header :). That's the idea
any way.

Please check it every time you've done a cvs update, because you MIGHT
ruin your system/db or something else if you don't take notice!!

Warnings of the day:
  * Fri Jul 13 11:53:05 CEST 2007
    Moved Samba defines PQL_CONF_SAMBA_SID and PQL_CONF_DAYSUNTILEXPIRE
    to the LDAP directory. Please re-read doc/README.samba if you use
    the samba/SMB manager of phpQLAdmin!
  * Previously, phpQLAdmin have had problems in finding users (actually
    distinguish users from other objects), and I've been fine tuning
    the search filters all the times. This have prieviously been hardcoded
    in the source, but can no be changed/set in 'Home->phpQLAdmin Configuration->[branch]'.
    You will still need to set the user reference attribute, but it
    is not used to find a user if a search filter is set.
