As of phpQLAdmin version 2.0.19 (or CVS tag HEAD as of Oct 13,
15:21:21), phpQLAdmin now supports (rudimentary) support for user
configuration of SpamAssassin rules.

This require that the spamAssassin attribute is enabled in the LDAP
server (see the files in the 'ldap' directory of the SpamAssassin
sources).
