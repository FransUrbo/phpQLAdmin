If you already have an LDAP database you'd like to administrate
through phpQLAdmin, it is a requirenment that you read README.acl.
If you don't (and fully understand it! :), you won't see your database,
no matter HOW you configure it.

If you're upgrading from phpQLAdmin version 2.0.2, then you MUST read
the README.upgrade file! It contains important information that will
break your admin interface (phpQLAdmin) if not fully understood.


Version 2.0 of phpQLAdmin was (re)designed to be more forgiving on how
the layout of the LDAP database is layed out. It does however dictate
slightly that you follow some kind of 'standard' (if there is such
a thing in the world of LDAP :). That is, it's very unforgiving if 
you have a flat database. If you do, don't use LDAP, use SQL!


To configure phpQLAdmin, copy the file include/config.inc.CHANGE_ME
to include/config.inc and change the latter. Go throug each line,
and decide where the database is, what's the base dn etc. From that,
the database should be layed out something like this:

	Domain layout			Organization layout
	dc=com				c=SE
	  dc=fredriksson		  ou=Fredriksson
	    ou=People			    ou=People
	      uid=usename		      uid=username
	    ou=Groups			    ou=Groups
	      cn=groupname		      cn=groupname
	  dc=winas			  ou=Winas
	    ou=People			    ou=People
	      uid=usename		      uid=username
	    ou=Groups			    ou=Groups
	      cn=groupname		      cn=groupname

Here I show two 'domains' - Fredriksson and Winas. What this means
is that users are under the 'ou=People' object and groups are under
the 'ou=Groups'. Each under the actual 'domain' object.

The 'domain' refer to the 'basetree' (dc=fredriksson/dc=winas and
ou=Fredriksson/ou=Winas in these two examples), NOT to the domainname!
In both examples, I use the top DN (dc=com or c=SE) as base search in
phpQLAdmin.

This layout is configured by defining PQL_LDAP_SUBTREE_USERS and/or
PQL_LDAP_SUBTREE_GROUPS, so without these, you CAN get a flat layout,
but please don't.


With version 2.0.5, it's possible to have site specific configurations
in the database. It is saved into the topmost RDN ('dc=com' or 'c=SE'
in my two examples above) objects, so make sure you have access to modify
this object. This is a matter of the LDAP server, not phpQLAdmin so consult
your LDAP servers documentation on how to do this.
