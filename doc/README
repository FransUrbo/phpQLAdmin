If you already have an LDAP database you'd like to administrate
through phpQLAdmin, it is a requirenment that you read README.acl.
If you don't (and fully understand it! :), you won't see your database,
no matter HOW you configure it.


Version 2.0 of phpQLAdmin was (re)designed to be more forgiving on how
the layout of the LDAP database is layed out. It does however dictate
slightly that you follow some kind of 'standard' (if there is such
a thing in the world of LDAP :). That is, it's very unforgiving if 
you have a flat database. If you do, don't use LDAP, use SQL!


To configure phpQLAdmin, copy the file include/config.inc.CHANGE_ME
to include/config.inc and change the latter. Go throug each line,
and deside where the database is, what's the base dn etc. From that,
the database should be layed out something like this:

	Domain layout			Organization layout
	dc=com				c=SE
	  dc=bayour			  ou=Fredriksson
	    ou=People			    ou=People
	      uid=usename		      uid=username
	    ou=Groups			    ou=Groups
	      cn=groupname		      cn=groupname

What this means is that users are under the 'ou=People' object and
groups are under the 'ou=Groups'. Each under the actuall 'domain'
object.

The 'domain' refer to the 'basetree' (dc=bayour and ou=Fredriksson
in these two examples), NOT to the domainname!

This layout is configured by defining PQL_LDAP_SUBTREE_USERS and/or
PQL_LDAP_SUBTREE_GROUPS, so without these, you CAN get a flat layout,
but please don't.
