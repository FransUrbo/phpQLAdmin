phpQLAdmin - Installation Guide
-------------------------------

$Id: INSTALL,v 2.1 2003-01-04 11:24:50 turbo Exp $


Software Requirements:
----------------------

- qmail-ldap (this is not required to get phpQLAdmin working, but why use
  phpQLAdmin w/o qmail-ldap ? :)
- LDAP server with support for "qmailuser" objectclass (tested with OpenLDAP 1.2.11)
- root access to the qmail-ldap DN
- Webserver (tested with Apache 1.3.14)
- PHP 4.0.x (tested with PHP 4.0.4pl) with compiled in LDAP support

Additional Requirements for qmail-ldap/control patch support:
-------------------------------------------------------------

- LDAP server with support for "qmailcontrol" objectclass
- "qmailcontrol" objectclass must contain all attributes which you want
  to administrate trough phpQLAdmin

Optional:
---------

- mhash-library compiled in PHP to support MD5 and SHA password encryption


Install:
--------

1. Untar the distribution (tar -zxf phpQLAdmin-x.x.x.tgz) to a directory
   below webserver's root.

2. If your webserver doesn't support 'index.php' as a directory index
   file, rename it to index.html or whatever your webserver supports.
   The index.php - file does not contain any php code, so it must not
   be interpreted with php engine.

3. Copy the file 'include/config.inc.CHANGE_ME' to 'include/config.inc'
   and edit config.inc. Change the properties needed to access your
   LDAP database (have a look at the configuration section in the
   documentation)

4. Try out :)
