How to install:

	1. Copy include/config.inc.CHANGE_ME to include/config.inc
	2. Change include/config.inc with values for you site
	3. Setup your PHP driver (apache etc) to include files from
	   this directory. This is done (on a Debian GNU/Linux box)
 	   in the file '/etc/php4/apache/php.ini'. 
	   Find the line that starts with 'include_path' and make
	   sure it contains the exact path to where you extracted
	   this source (usually somewhere in your DocumentRoot).
