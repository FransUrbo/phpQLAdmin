There are a number of files you can create in this
directory to simplify bugfixing. They all start with
'.DEBUG_' (notice the dot -> makes it 'hidden').

.DEBUG_ME
	General debug information. Will not write
	to the LDAP server, but instead show you
	and LDIF on what it (phpQLAdmin) WOULD
	send to the LDAP server.

.DEBUG_CACHE
	Shows information about the caching system.
	- Requires the '.DEBUG_ME' file.

.DEBUG_DISABLE_CACHE
	Disables caching completely

.DEBUG_DEFINES
	Show information about retreival and setting
	of the 'defines' (global config values).

.DEBUG_PROFILING
	Shows the current date and time (as a UNIX
	timestamp - seconds from Jan 1, 1970) at
	the beginning and ending of a script.
	Can be used to do profiling (how long does
	an action take).
	You'll still have to calculate the amount
	of seconds it took yourself :)



When sending in bugreports, please have _at least_
the .DEBUG_ME file and cut-and-past the resulting
output. The more information you send, the bigger
chance I have in finding and fixing the bug(s).
