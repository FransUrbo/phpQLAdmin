There are a number of files you can create in this
directory to simplify bugfixing. They all start with
'.DEBUG_' (notice the dot -> makes it 'hidden').

.DEBUG_ME
	General debug information. Will not write
	to the LDAP server, but instead show you
	an LDIF on what it (phpQLAdmin) WOULD
	send to the LDAP server.

	As of CVS 20061201, this is now also possible to set via the
	config interface. Go to 'Home->phpQLAdmin Configuration->
	Global configuration->Run phpQLAdmin in debug mode'.

.DEBUG_CACHE
	Shows information about the caching system.
	- Requires the '.DEBUG_ME' file.

.DEBUG_DISABLE_CACHE
	Disables caching completely

.DEBUG_PROFILING
	Shows the current date and time (as a UNIX
	timestamp - seconds from Jan 1, 1970) at
	the beginning and ending of a script.
	Can be used to do profiling (how long does
	an action take).
	You'll still have to calculate the amount
	of seconds it took yourself :)

.DEBUG_WEBSRV
	Shows all arrays (servers, virtual servers
	and virtual server directories) in the domain
	details->Webserver manager.

.DEBUG_AUTOMOUNT
	Shows some debugging regarding Automounts

.DEBUG_DOMAINS
	Shows information about domain/branch retreivals.
	Use this if you have problem in seeing your domains.

.DEBUG_LDIF
	Like .DEBUG_ME, but output a clean LDIF instead of
	the '--- DEBUG*' separators.

When sending in bugreports, please have _at least_
the .DEBUG_ME file and cut-and-past the resulting
output. The more information you send, the bigger
chance I have in finding and fixing the bug(s).
