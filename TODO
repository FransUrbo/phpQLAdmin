Things left to do
	* Enable re-login to other LDAP server - choose LDAP server at
	  runtime.
	* Support for user templates (predefined attributes
	  for a group of users) .
	* Support for alias-domains: phpQLAdmin will be able to create
	  domain aliases e.g domain.ch will forward all registred
	  accounts to the equal account of domain.com.
	  Changes in the aliased domain will be automatically replicated
	  to the alias domain.
	* Output a template DNS zone file after domain is created.
	* Create, delete or modify the Kerberos principal if using {KERBEROS}
	  password scheme.
	* Allow for (Open)AFS creation, deletion and modification.

	EZMLM mailinglist
	* Remove hardcoded texts (attributes and such).
	* Stresstest list creation and modification.
	* Implement list deletion.
	* Remove 'hardcoded' path to /var/list. This IS configurable at
	  runtime, but we need to look for lists in each domains
	  'baseMailDir'.
