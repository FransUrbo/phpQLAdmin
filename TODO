Things left to do
	* Enable re-login to other LDAP server

	EZMLM mailinglist
	* Remove hardcoded texts (attributes and such).
	* Stresstest list creation and modification
	* Implement list deletion
	* Remove 'hardcoded' path to /var/list. This
	  IS configurable at runtime, but we need to
	  look for lists in each domains 'baseMailDir'.
