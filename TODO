Things left to do
	IMPORTANT
	* If we're modifying a value and we're missing an objectclass
	  and the objectclass we find that REQUIRE (MAY) some attributes
	  which we're missing, ask user/admin to fill in the missing
	  attributes, THEN retry to add/modify the object.

	WISHLIST/Not so very important
	* Support for alias-domains: phpQLAdmin will be able to create
	  domain aliases e.g domain.ch will forward all registred
	  accounts to the equal account of domain.com.
	  Changes in the aliased domain will be automatically replicated
	  to the alias domain.
	* When deleting a user, ask if archive or delete the existing mailbox.
	  - Give away the deleted users mailbox to another user.

	EZMLM mailinglist
	* What about access control to directories etc?
	  - How can I create/delete lists in domain's baseMailDir/mailinglists,
	    AND create the directories if they don't exists - ie, when creating
	    a new domain.
