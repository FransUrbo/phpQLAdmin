Things left to do
	* Support for alias-domains: phpQLAdmin will be able to create
	  domain aliases e.g domain.ch will forward all registred
	  accounts to the equal account of domain.com.
	  Changes in the aliased domain will be automatically replicated
	  to the alias domain.
	* When deleting a user, ask if archive or delete the existing mailbox.
	  - Give away the deleted users mailbox to another user.

	IMPORTANT
	* Automatic ACL update when adding a user as administrator for domain/branch.
	  Currently the LDAP server ACL have to be updated, and the LDAP server
	  restarted. This is naturaly not desired behaviour...
	* Disallow administrator to create/modify mailinglists.
	* Delete or modify the Kerberos principal if using {KERBEROS}
	  password scheme.
	* If we're modifying a value and we're missing an objectclass and the
	  objectclass we find that REQUIRE (MAY) some attributes which we're
	  missing, ask user/admin to fill in the missing attributes, THEN retry
	  to add/modify the object.

	EZMLM mailinglist
	* Remove hardcoded texts (attributes and such).
	* What about access control to directories etc?
	  - How can I create/delete lists in domain's baseMailDir/mailinglists,
	    AND create the directories if they don't exists - ie, when creating
	    a new domain.
	* If a user is deleted, check all local mailinglists for subscription and
	  unsubscribe mail address(es).
