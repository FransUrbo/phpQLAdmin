Things left to do
	BUGS
	* Fix Domain details->Host Control the same way as Domain details->Sudo was -
	  by rewriting the whole thing to phpQLAdmin standars (i.e. use include/attrib.*.inc
	  file etc).

	IMPORTANT
	* If we're modifying a value and we're missing an objectclass
	  and the objectclass we find that REQUIRE (MAY) some attributes
	  which we're missing, ask user/admin to fill in the missing
	  attributes, THEN retry to add/modify the object.
	  + Much/Most of this is already there, it just needs to be even
	    smarter!

	WISHLIST/Not so very important
	* Fix 'Computers->Global->Mailserver Administration'. It currently doesn't
	  show all the QLC objects (see 'Computers->Global->Webserver Administration').
	  +  The current view should be moved to something like 'All mailserver values'.
	  => I haven't decided if this actually wanted though!!
	* Support for alias-domains: phpQLAdmin will be able to create
	  domain aliases e.g domain.ch will forward all registred
	  accounts to the equal account of domain.com.
	  Changes in the aliased domain will be automatically replicated
	  to the alias domain.
	* When deleting a user, ask if archive or delete the existing mailbox.
	  - Give away the deleted users mailbox to another user.

	EZMLM mailinglist
	* What about access control to directories etc?
	  - How can I create/delete lists in domain's baseMailDir/mailinglists,
	    AND create the directories if they don't exists - ie, when creating
	    a new domain.
