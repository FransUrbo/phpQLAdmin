Things left to do
	EASY
	* As of version 1.61.10.2.4.1.2.1 of include/pql_config.inc,
	  the base DN is availible in a session variable. Make any and
	  all functions that uses or needs this value to use the variable
	  instead of retreive it from the LDAP database.
	* New schema attribute/value and corresponding config option
	  (global or branch!?): 'Generate Maildirs instead of MBoxes'.

	IMPORTANT
	* Get proper (!) 'user templates' to work. It's getting more
	  and more difficult to get the schema enforcement to work
	  properly. I just wish I had an idea on HOW to do it :)
	* Delete or modify the Kerberos principal if using {KERBEROS}
	  password scheme.
	* If we're modifying a value and we're missing an objectclass
	  and the objectclass we find that REQUIRE (MAY) some attributes
	  which we're missing, ask user/admin to fill in the missing
	  attributes, THEN retry to add/modify the object.
	* Finish the new QmailLDAP/Controls values
	  http://apache.bayour.com/list/cvs-phpqladmin/?action=show_msg&actionargs[]=22&actionargs[]=30

	WISHLIST/Not so very important
	* Support for alias-domains: phpQLAdmin will be able to create
	  domain aliases e.g domain.ch will forward all registred
	  accounts to the equal account of domain.com.
	  Changes in the aliased domain will be automatically replicated
	  to the alias domain.
	* When deleting a user, ask if archive or delete the existing mailbox.
	  - Give away the deleted users mailbox to another user.

	EZMLM mailinglist
	* What about access control to directories etc?
	  - How can I create/delete lists in domain's baseMailDir/mailinglists,
	    AND create the directories if they don't exists - ie, when creating
	    a new domain.
