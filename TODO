Things left to do
	* Support for user templates (predefined attributes for a group of users).
	* Support for alias-domains: phpQLAdmin will be able to create
	  domain aliases e.g domain.ch will forward all registred
	  accounts to the equal account of domain.com.
	  Changes in the aliased domain will be automatically replicated
	  to the alias domain.

	IMPORTANT
	* Create, delete or modify the Kerberos principal if using {KERBEROS}
	  password scheme.
	* Allow for (Open)AFS creation, deletion and modification.

	EZMLM mailinglist
	* Remove hardcoded texts (attributes and such).
	* What about access control to directories etc?
	  - How can I create/delete lists in domain's baseMailDir/mailinglists,
	    AND create the directories if they don't exists - ie, when creating
	    a new domain.
